<Warning>
  **Breaking the server rules will lead to punishments.**

  Moderation Thresholds:

  - You may not rejoin for 30 minutes after being kicked.
  - Accumulating 2 moderations in one session will result in a kick.
  - Accumulating 10 moderations in total will result in a permanent ban.

  **Moderations are tracked and accumulate over time. Please follow all server rules to avoid disciplinary action.**
</Warning>

<Card title="Baiting & Rushing Roleplays" icon="rotate-right">
  Rushing or forcing scenes disrupts immersion and gives unfair advantages.

  - **What this means:** Roleplays should flow naturally. Don't provoke, bait, or rush others into interactions — whether it's law enforcement, medical personnel, or other players.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Purposefully trying to get police to chase you (cop baiting).
    - Immediately handcuffing or jailing players without giving them time to react.
    - Skipping medical roleplay or forcing instant treatment.
</Card>

<Card title="Death Roleplay" icon="heart-pulse">
  Death and injuries must always be roleplayed realistically.

  - **What this means:** If your character dies, you must wait for EMS or the scene to finish before respawning. Injuries should be portrayed seriously, not ignored or minimized.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Instantly respawning without waiting for medical help.
    - Claiming to be fine after being shot multiple times.
    - Ignoring injuries or acting unaffected by lethal damage.
</Card>

<Card title="GTA Driving" icon="car">
  Driving behavior should be realistic and fit the tone of roleplay.

  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Driving 100 mph+ outside of active pursuits.
    - Starting a chase with police for no reason.
    - Ignoring sirens or driving recklessly through crowds.
</Card>

<Card title="General Realism" icon="gear">
  Players should behave and respond as realistically as possible in all situations.

  - **What this means:** Fear roleplay must always be followed — your character should value their life. LEOs and emergency responders can take reasonable risks but still need to remain believable.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Ignoring fear when held at gunpoint or surrounded.
    - Failing to roleplay injuries after major crashes (25 MPH+).
    - Using sirens or PA systems unrealistically or at extreme volume.
</Card>

<Card title="Vehicle Deathmatch | VDM" icon="car-tilt">

  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Ramming another car without roleplay buildup.
    - Running over civilians for fun.
    - Using your car to attack or troll others.
</Card>

<Card title="New Life Rule | NLR" icon="skull">
  When you die, your character forgets everything that happened before death.

  - **What this means:** You must not return to the same scene or seek revenge after dying. Treat each new life as a completely new chapter.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Returning to your death location after respawning.
    - Getting revenge on players from a previous life.
    - Using information from before your death in a new scene.
</Card>

<Card title="Random Deathmatch | RDM" icon="crosshairs">
  Every act of violence must have proper context or escalation.

  - **What this means:** Use of deadly force should always make sense within roleplay.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Shooting another player because of a small argument.
    - Attacking officers during a traffic stop for no reason.
    - Killing random players without prior roleplay.
</Card>

<Card title="Avatar Realism" icon="user-cowboy">

  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Wearing unrealistic or meme-style outfits.
    - Using animal avatars outside approved animal RP.
    - Civilians wearing vests, helmets, or heavy tactical gear.
</Card>

<Card title="Department Basics" icon="shield">
  Departments must follow their specific guidelines, use proper uniforms, and act professionally at all times.

  - **What this means:** While roleplaying as part of a department, you must wear the correct uniform, use approved liveries, and follow all department protocols. Unofficial or self-created departments are not allowed. Law enforcement, fire, and DOT personnel are expected to uphold professionalism at all times.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Using "undercover" or "whitelisted" liveries without authorization.
    - Driving restricted vehicles like Hazmat trucks or the Med Bus without proper rank.
    - Creating or representing an unapproved department.
    - Disobeying commands from applied supervisors or command staff.
    - Fleeing from police while on a department team (LEO, FD, or DOT).
    - EMS/FD personnel engaging in pursuits, arrests, or combative actions.
</Card>

<Card title="Priority Roleplays" icon="flame">
  Major roleplays must be planned and authorized to keep the game organized and fair for everyone.

  - **What this means:** Large-scale events such as robberies or hostage situations require staff approval before starting. Violence during peace or priority cooldowns is never allowed. You can refuse to be a hostage, but the roleplay must conclude logically.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Starting a bank robbery or hostage RP without moderator permission.
    - Taking or killing EMS/FD members as hostages.
    - Engaging in pursuits or fights during a priority or peace timer.
    - Conducting more than five robberies within a 30-minute period.
</Card>

<Card title="Safezones" icon="map-pin">
  Safezones are areas where violence and pursuits cannot occur or pass through.

  - **What this means:** These areas exist to give players safe places to spawn, roleplay, or reset without being interrupted. Entering a safezone to escape roleplay or start violence is prohibited.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Shooting or chasing players through safezones.
    - Starting roleplays inside designated safe areas.

    - Exploiting, hacking, or using third-party software.
    - Harassing or threatening other players.
    - Sharing personal information or engaging in unsafe behavior.
</Card>

<Card title="Common Sense" icon="lightbulb">
  Not every possible rule is listed, so players are expected to use logic and fair judgment.

  - **What this means:** If something seems unreasonable or breaks the spirit of the rules, don't do it. Trying to stop another rule violation does not excuse breaking rules yourself. Additional clarifications may be pinned in server channels.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Justifying poor behavior because "it's not written down."
    - Breaking a rule to stop someone else's violation.
    - Ignoring updates or expansions pinned in game-chat.

    - Ignoring traffic stop procedures or arrest protocol.
    - Using unauthorized equipment or vehicles.
    - Disregarding department guidelines outlined in the regulation document.
</Card>

<Card title="Interrupting Roleplays" icon="triangle-exclamation">
  Respect ongoing scenes and avoid interfering without reason.

  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Entering a police or EMS scene that's blocked off.
    - Forcing your character into an ongoing RP.
    - Ignoring cones, barriers, or tape meant to block access.
