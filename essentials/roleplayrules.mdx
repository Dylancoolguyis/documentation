  <Card title="Baiting & Rushing Roleplays" icon="rotate-right">
    Rushing or forcing scenes disrupts immersion and gives unfair advantages.

    - **What this means:** Roleplays should flow naturally. Don't provoke, bait, or rush others into interactions — whether it's law enforcement, medical personnel, or other players.
    - **Examples of violations:**
    - Purposefully trying to get police to chase you (cop baiting).
    - Immediately handcuffing or jailing players without giving them time to react.
    - Skipping medical roleplay or forcing instant treatment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Death Roleplay" icon="heart-pulse">
    Death and injuries must always be roleplayed realistically.

    - **What this means:** If your character dies, you must wait for EMS or the scene to finish before respawning. Injuries should be portrayed seriously, not ignored or minimized.
    - **Examples of violations:**
      - Instantly respawning without waiting for medical help.
      - Claiming to be fine after being shot multiple times.
      - Ignoring injuries or acting unaffected by lethal damage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="GTA Driving" icon="car">
    Driving behavior should be realistic and fit the tone of roleplay.

    - **What this means:** You must drive reasonably and yield to emergency vehicles. Avoid unnecessary pursuits and chaotic driving unless it's part of a justified scenario.
    - **Examples of violations:**
      - Driving 100 mph+ outside of active pursuits.
      - Starting a chase with police for no reason.
      - Ignoring sirens or driving recklessly through crowds.
  </Card>
  <Card title="General Realism" icon="gear">
    Players should behave and respond as realistically as possible in all situations.

    - **What this means:** Fear roleplay must always be followed — your character should value their life. LEOs and emergency responders can take reasonable risks but still need to remain believable.
    - **Examples of violations:**
      - Ignoring fear when held at gunpoint or surrounded.
      - Failing to roleplay injuries after major crashes (25 MPH+).
      - Using sirens or PA systems unrealistically or at extreme volume.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Vehicle Deathmatch | VDM" icon="car-tilt">
    Vehicles must never be used as weapons unless justified through proper roleplay.

    - **What this means:** You should never intentionally ram, run over, or damage other vehicles or players without in-character reasoning.
    - **Examples of violations:**
      - Ramming another car without roleplay buildup.
      - Running over civilians for fun.
      - Using your car to attack or troll others.
  </Card>
  <Card title="New Life Rule | NLR" icon="skull">
    When you die, your character forgets everything that happened before death.

    - **What this means:** You must not return to the same scene or seek revenge after dying. Treat each new life as a completely new chapter.
    - **Examples of violations:**
      - Returning to your death location after respawning.
      - Getting revenge on players from a previous life.
      - Using information from before your death in a new scene.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Random Deathmatch | RDM" icon="crosshairs">
    Every act of violence must have proper context or escalation.

    - **What this means:** Use of deadly force should always make sense within roleplay.
    - **Examples of violations:**
      - Shooting another player because of a small argument.
      - Attacking officers during a traffic stop for no reason.
      - Killing random players without prior roleplay.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Avatar Realism" icon="user-cowboy">
    Avatars must reflect the realistic tone of the server.

    - **What this means:** Civilian characters should appear believable and appropriate. Only authorized teams may use tactical or combat gear.
    - **Examples of violations:**
      - Wearing unrealistic or meme-style outfits.
      - Using animal avatars outside approved animal RP.
      - Civilians wearing vests, helmets, or heavy tactical gear.
