<Card title="Voice Chat" icon="microphone">
  Voice Chat rules ensure communication remains clear and respectful. All players should maintain an environment where everyone can communicate without disruption or discomfort.

  - **What this means:** When using voice channels, your microphone should be clear and free of loud background noise. Conversations should remain respectful and related to the game or topic at hand. Disruptive or excessive noise ruins the experience for others.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Playing loud music, soundboards, or “earrape” audio through your mic.
    - Constantly interrupting others or yelling over conversations.
    - Using your mic to spam sounds, talk excessively off-topic, or harass other players.
</Card>

<Card title="Nicknames" icon="tag">
  Nicknames help staff and players identify each other easily across platforms. Consistency ensures smooth communication and organization.

  - **What this means:** Your Discord nickname must clearly match your Roblox username. This helps staff verify who you are in-game and in the community. Avoid using unreadable symbols or joke names.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Using a nickname that doesn’t match your Roblox username.
    - Constantly changing your nickname to troll or confuse others.
    - Using inappropriate or offensive names.
</Card>

<Card title="Pinging" icon="bell">
  Pinging rules prevent spam and ensure that members — especially staff — aren’t disturbed unnecessarily.

  - **What this means:** Only ping users when it’s necessary for a specific reason. If you need help from management or staff, open a support ticket instead of tagging them directly.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Spamming or repeatedly pinging members for no reason.
    - Tagging management directly instead of using tickets.
    - Pinging anyone inside a support ticket conversation.
</Card>

<Card title="Advertising" icon="ban">
  Advertising rules keep the community focused and free from unsolicited promotions.

  - **What this means:** Do not promote other Discord servers, games, or personal social media accounts within this community. Respect others’ space and avoid unsolicited messages.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Posting invites or links to other servers in chat.
    - DMing members to promote your own server or project.
    - Sharing your social media purely for self-promotion.
</Card>

<Card title="Alternate Accounts" icon="people">
  To maintain fairness and prevent abuse, only one account is allowed per person.

  - **What this means:** Each user should participate in the community using a single account. Alternate or “alt” accounts create confusion and can be used to evade moderation.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Creating or using multiple Discord or Roblox accounts.
    - Using an alt account after being banned or muted.
    - Claiming someone else’s account as your “backup.”
</Card>

<Card title="Common Sense & Discord Policy" icon="scale-balanced">
  Everyone is expected to behave respectfully and follow both community rules and Discord’s official guidelines.

  - **What this means:** Use basic judgment and treat others respectfully. Any actions violating Discord’s Terms of Service or Community Guidelines will lead to moderation action.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Sharing explicit or illegal content.
    - Harassing, discriminating, or threatening other members.
    - Exploiting loopholes or claiming “it’s not in the rules” as an excuse for toxic behavior.
